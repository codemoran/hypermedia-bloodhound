# Hypermedia Bloodhound

# pre-requirements

The Hypermedia Bloodhound depends on libpcap, so if you are on linux, you need to install the package first (```sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev```), if you are on OSX 10.6+, you already have it.

# to get started

```
$ npm install
$ node bin/sniff
```

# looking for help

```
$ node bin/bloodhound --help
```
