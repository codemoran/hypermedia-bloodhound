# Hypermedia Bloodhound

# pre-requirements

The Hypermedia Bloodhound depends on libpcap, so if you are on linux, you need to install the package first (```sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev```), if you are on OSX 10.6+, you already have it.

We also depends on ```libgeoip``` for the IP address lookups, so ```sudo apt-get install libgeoip``` or ```brew install libgeoip``` on OSX.
